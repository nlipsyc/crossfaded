    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="lg-type">Crossfaded takes a database of hip hop lyrics, removes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a>and breaks them into 5 word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">ngrams</a>.  It then looks for ngrams that are shared between multiple songs.<br> </p>
    <p class="lg-type">Crossfaded is an ongoing project that uses a corpus of hip hop lyrics to find interesting links between hip hop artists. By finding unique phrases that are only shared by a few artist, we can establish connections between them. These shared phrases could come about as a result of paying homage, intertextual allusion, or simple plagiarism. Outside the realm of modern intellectual property, this is a common an well accepted practice in blues music, a genre where rap music has deep roots.<br></p>
